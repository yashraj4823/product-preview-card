## Overview
  This is the solution of the problem given in the Hacktoberfest 2023.


### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Links

- Live Site URL:()


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned to use the adjacent sibling selector to make the view icon appear on hover.

.view {
  display: none;
}
.image-container:hover .overlay + .view {
  display: block;
}


### Continued development

For future projects I need to focus on using more advanced CSS to create effects.
